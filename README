YogaHero yoga pose matching software

Written by Larry Reaves <larry@yrral.net>

make builds three executables:

findmatch:
matches an image to a pose
produces match.png (image of matching model), match.pose (saved model),
and match.data (timing/error data)

modelviewer:
view the model with sliders to change angles/segment lengths/camera params
also, can load and save models to files

test:
runs findmatch with various parameters on the given image and pose
saves match.png, match.pose, and match.data to
images/output/image-basename/ for each test

make also has a test_all target, which when invoked matches all the images
to all the poses, making some assumptions about filenames (the image will
be in images/*posename.png and the poses are in poses/posename)
